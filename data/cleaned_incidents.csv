To resolve the issue, the firewall rule was updated to allow traffic on the correct port number (port 3306) from the application server to the database server. This change was tested in the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environment and was successful in restoring the connection between the two servers. 

After confirming the successful resolution in UAT, the firewall rule was applied to the Production (PROD) environment. A thorough verification process was conducted, and the communication between the database server and the application server is now functioning as expected in the PROD environment.

Additionally, upon reviewing the code logic in the application module, we discovered a bug in the authentication process that was causing intermittent login failures. The root cause was found to be a missing validation check for expired user sessions. To address this, we implemented a fix that includes a session timeout mechanism to prevent users from encountering login issues due to expired sessions.

Lastly, during the testing phase in the UAT environment, we conducted thorough testing to validate the changes made in both the network and application modules. After confirming that all functionalities were working as expected without any issues, the changes were promoted to the PROD environment. The fix has been applied and verified in PROD, and we are closing this ticket as resolved. Thank you for your patience as we worked to address these issues."

To resolve this issue, we updated the subnet mask configuration in the network module to match the correct settings. After applying the changes, we conducted thorough testing in the UAT environment to ensure that the communication between the devices was restored. Once the issue was resolved in UAT, we proceeded to apply the fix in the production environment.

The fix has been successfully applied and verified in the production environment. All affected devices are now able to communicate properly without any issues. Thank you for your patience and understanding regarding this matter."

After further investigation, we have identified that the issue with the slow performance of the server was caused by a bottleneck in the database configuration. Specifically, the database was hitting its maximum connections limit, causing delays in processing requests. To address this, we increased the maximum connections limit in the database configuration to accommodate the current workload.

Furthermore, we also optimized the queries being executed on the database by adding appropriate indexes to improve query performance. This optimization helped reduce the overall processing time for queries, leading to a noticeable improvement in server performance. Additionally, we conducted thorough testing in the UAT environment to ensure that the changes did not introduce any new issues.

To resolve this issue, the configuration settings of the email server module were updated to use the correct authentication method, ensuring that users can now send emails without encountering any authentication errors.

Additionally, a code logic review was conducted to ensure that there were no discrepancies in the code that could potentially be causing the authentication failures. It was discovered that a recent code update had inadvertently introduced a bug that was affecting the email server module's authentication process. The code logic was corrected, and all necessary tests were conducted in the UAT environment to verify that the issue had been resolved.

After confirming that the changes were successfully implemented and tested in the UAT environment, the fix was applied to the production environment. The email server module was thoroughly monitored in the production environment to ensure that the authentication issues no longer persisted. The resolution has been verified in the production environment, and no further action is required at this time.","Upon further investigation of the reported issue, it was determined that the root cause lies in the configuration settings of the email server module.

To resolve this issue, we updated the SMTP settings in the email server configuration file to use the correct port number.

Additionally, we also noticed that the email server was experiencing high load due to a large number of undelivered emails in the queue. This was caused by a spike in incoming emails during a recent marketing campaign. To address this, we increased the server resources and optimized the email queue processing to handle the influx of emails more efficiently.

After applying these changes, we performed extensive testing in the UAT environment to ensure that the email server was functioning correctly.
